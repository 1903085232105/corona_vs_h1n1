# corona_vs_h1n1
A data scraping project

Three collaborators -- Jack Barney, Jason Hernandez, and Ron Daniel -- scraped data from Wikipedia on the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic in the United states, and World-O-Meters real-time COVID-19 data for the United States. We assembled these data into PostgreSQL tables, combined them, and compared the two pandemics.

At the time of data scraping, COVID-19 had been verified in the United States for approximately one month, and the death toll had already reached half of the total death toll for the entire H1N1 pandemic. This data indicated that the naysayers claiming that COVID-19 is "no worse than the flu" were quite mistaken.
